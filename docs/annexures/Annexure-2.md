# Annexure 2 — Proposed Amendments to the NestaPrime Estimator Application

**Version 1.10 | Date: 12 September 2026 | Status: DRAFT — Pending Director Approval**

Source: `Annexure-2_NestaPrime-Estimator_Amendments.docx`, prepared by R. Patni (with AI
development assistance). Committed here as the governing change register — see
[`README.md`](../../README.md) for how it fits into the rest of the project record.

**v1.10 changes (12 September, review session 2):** Amendment No. 4 expanded with
acceptance criteria confirmed live on production, plus refinements found while
reviewing the dashboard and nav with a sales-rep workflow in mind (project search,
per-client project list, naming clarity, plain-language activity feed, admin/user
role separation). Amendment No. 5 expanded to absorb the 12 September parking-lot
item (Director decision: merge, not a new amendment). Note R3 added for two
launch-night housekeeping items that never got a formal home. Nothing in this
version has been implemented — recording only, per the Change Process below.

---

## 0. Governing Philosophy — The NPS Picture

The app serves one conversation: what the client HAS → what he WANTS → the NPS solution →
the PRICE → cross-sell. Ultimate goal: "the app's purpose is to be fully customizable to
meet specific business requirements." Every amendment must serve these points.

## 1. Change Process

1. Record in this register.
2. Director approves → complete amended specification prepared.
3. Only then implement (branch → PR → tests → merge → deploy).

**REGISTER FREEZE RULE**: No new amendments until the current wave ships. New ideas go to
a parking lot list, reviewed at each wave's completion.

## 2. Register of Proposed Amendments

### Amendment No. 1 — Brand-Themed and Animated UI (Match Company Website)
Dark premium theme, gold `#c9a227` accents, animated sport-tile selection with court
diagram, subtle motion (0.2–0.3s). "The user is not bored and wants to work." Frontend
styling only.

### Amendment No. 2 — Simplified "New Project Setup" Form
Blind-quoting principle: 5 required fields (Client · Sport · City · Dimensions · Base
scope/status); soil type, distance, court count, site access, power/water removed (→
T&C); Quick vs Detailed modes.

### Amendment No. 3 — "Complete Your Facility" Cross-Sell at Estimate Step
At the Estimate step, suggest 4–5 sport-matched add-ons (lighting, fencing, seating, AMC)
with prices and own margins; one-tap add; never forced.

### Amendment No. 4 — Main Dashboard + Guided Navigation
Business-summary dashboard; link back to dashboard from every section; guided step-path
with progress bar; menu grouped Daily Work / Management / Admin. "The app itself is the
training."

**Confirmed live on production (12 Sept validation run) — these are Amendment 4's
acceptance criteria, not separate asks:** no logout control anywhere in the UI; no
screen to browse or reopen an existing project (the "Existing client" picker only
starts a *new* project; the Clients directory has no per-client project links); the
"Back to project" button always opens a blank New Project Setup screen instead of
resuming anything; the User Management screen exists but isn't reachable from any menu.

**Refinements added 12 Sept (review session 2, sales-rep workflow check):**
- The dashboard's project list needs search/filter, not just "last N recent" — a
  recent-only list stops helping once the project count grows past a screenful.
- The Clients page itself needs a per-client project list, not just the global
  recent-projects list on the dashboard — this is the specific half of the
  production gap above that a dashboard alone doesn't fix.
- "Pricing Calculator" (nav item) vs. the actual Cost Sheet → Estimate → Quotation
  flow needs a naming decision so a new user isn't left guessing which one produces
  a real quotation.
- **Admin and user accounts are genuinely separated, not just visually grouped**
  (Director instruction, 12 Sept): Master Settings, Sports & Scope Admin, Audit
  Log, and User Management are hidden entirely for any role other than
  Director/Admin — not placed under an "Admin" heading that every role still sees.
  No unused headers shown to a role that can't act on them. This is pulled forward
  from Amendment 6a as the minimum viable slice.
- The Recent Activity feed renders in plain business language ("Dimensions updated
  for P-2609-0002: 60×30 → 30×60 m", "New PM account created") — not raw
  field-level diffs (`actual_dimensions: NonexNone → NonexNone`, `is_active: True →
  False`). Raw diffs stay on the Audit Log screen only.
- The dashboard's project list tags or filters out calibration/test projects (see
  Note R1) so real client work isn't crowded by validation data.

**Bugs bundled into this amendment's build (logged here so they aren't lost, not new
scope):** dimensions render as literal text `NonexNone` when blank instead of "Not
set"; today's nav bar has inconsistent spacing (Clients/Reports/Price Requests sit
tighter than the rest of the row) — moot once this amendment replaces the nav, worth
a direct fix only if this amendment slips.

### Amendment No. 5 — Customizable Forms: Admin Controls Compulsory Fields
Every dropdown gets a "None" option; admin sets each field compulsory/optional/hidden
from Master Settings. Phase 1: None options + dashboard. Phase 2: field-settings panel.

**Merged in 12 Sept (Director decision — was parking-lot, reconciled as scope of this
amendment, not a separate one):**
- **Dropdown "Others" rule** — append "Others" to every dropdown component in the
  app; selecting it dynamically renders a text input below; the typed text becomes
  the display label on Cost Sheets and Quotation PDFs.
- **Custom Notes component** — a reusable "+ Add Note" button on Project Setup, Cost
  Sheet, and Estimate screens; toggles a multi-line textarea for unstructured
  remarks; persisted on the Project record; passed through to the Quotation PDF
  under "Special Remarks / T&C".

### Amendment No. 6 — User Rights Management + Reporting & Oversight
6a: role-based permissions (what each role can see/do). 6b: admin reviews all quotations
and daily activity. 6c: reports for daily / weekly / monthly / full-year / custom ranges.

### Amendment No. 7 — Vendor & Product Master
Vendor lists with vendor codes; products with approximate pricing under each vendor;
feeds rate sheet and price-update requests.

### Amendment No. 8 — Communication & Integrations (WhatsApp, Email, Telegram)
Document sharing and messaging from the app with delivery status. Opportunity:
investigate the company's existing wa-gateway server before any paid BSP. Telegram
easiest to start. Largest build; after Amendments 1–7.

### Amendment No. 9 — Flexible Court Sizing
Standard sizes become configurable suggestions per sport — adjustable smaller/larger per
project; admin-editable (links to No. 5).

### Amendment No. 10 — User Handbook (Guide for the Team)
**Why (Director)**: "One of the most important things" — a handbook the team can learn
from without calling the boss.

**Contents**:
1. One-page QUICK START card (the 5-step daily path, printable, kept at each desk).
2. Full handbook: every screen explained in plain business language with screenshots —
   what each field means, what to fill when the client hasn't provided data, and worked
   examples from real projects (e.g. the Ujjain Pickleball job).
3. Separate short sections per role: Estimator guide and Director/Admin guide (users,
   rates, reports).
4. FAQ: the twenty questions the team will actually ask (password reset, what to do when
   a quotation is rejected, how to revise, etc.).

**Language & format**: Simple English with Hindi terms where the team uses them
(estimators think in "labour, material, dhanda" — the handbook should speak that
language). PDF + printable; also lives inside the app under a "Help" button.

**Maintenance**: Handbook version-numbered; every shipped amendment wave updates the
relevant chapter (same discipline as this annexure).

## Register Notes (non-software, business-process)

**Note R1 — Rate validation**: Validate the estimation engine against FY 23–24 actuals
(projects file on record): recreate one or two past projects in the app, compare totals
against real costs, tune rate tables where they diverge. Prerequisite for trusting every
quotation the app produces.

**Note R2 — Backup & restore drill**: Quarterly: restore a Lightsail snapshot to a test
instance and confirm app + data return correctly. A backup never restored is a hope, not
a backup.

**Note R3 — Launch-night housekeeping**: Two items from the original post-launch
punch list were never formally closed out.

(1) **Still open.** Deactivate the placeholder/test account(s) from setup — the live
audit log shows a *Director*-role account, `agent-temp@nestaprime.com`, created 12
September, which looks like exactly this kind of leftover test account and should be
confirmed and deactivated. This needs a Director to act directly in production (User
Management → find the account → set Inactive); the app's own guardrail
(`backend/app/api/users.py::update_user`) already permits deactivating a Director-role
account as long as at least one *other* active Director remains, so this is a one-click
action once confirmed, not a DB script.

(2) **Confirmed closed (13 Sept code check).** `distance_km`'s bound validation lives
on the single shared `ProjectCreate` schema (`backend/app/api/projects.py`) that both
Quick-mode (`handleQuickSubmit`) and Detailed-mode (`handleSubmit`) submit through in
`frontend/src/ProjectSetup.jsx` — there is no separate Quick-mode schema that could
have missed the fix. Quick mode simply never populates `distance_km` (defaults to
`None`, which the `ge=0, le=99999.9` bound accepts); Detailed mode sends it as a real
number and is validated by the same bound before it reaches Postgres. One schema, one
fix, both paths covered.

## 3. Priority & Sequencing (Recommended)

No calendar commitment (no "Week N" deadlines) -- work proceeds in small sections, each
shipped through the full branch → PR → tests → merge → deploy cycle before the next
starts. The order below is the priority, not a schedule.

| Section | Amendments / Notes | Why this order |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | No. 2 + No. 4 (form + dashboard/guided) | Makes the app USABLE daily |
| 2 | No. 9 (court sizing) — quick win | Small change, immediate flexibility |
| 3 | Note R1: rate validation | Makes the numbers TRUSTWORTHY |
| 4 | No. 1 (branding) + No. 10 (handbook quick-start card) | Beautiful + team can start |
| 5 | No. 10 full handbook + No. 6a/6c (rights + reports) | Team trained; control and oversight |
| 6 | No. 5 (customizable fields) + No. 7 (vendor master) | Flexibility + procurement bridge |
| 7 | No. 3 (cross-sell) | Revenue multiplier once flow is right |
| 8 | No. 8 (integrations) | Investigate wa-gateway first |
| Ongoing | Note R2: restore drill | Data safety, recurring regardless of build sequence |

## Parking Lot

New ideas raised after the v1.9 freeze, held here per the Register Freeze Rule (Part 1)
until reviewed at the next wave's completion -- not approved, not scheduled, not
implemented.

*(Empty as of v1.10 — the item raised 12 September, "Amendment No. 5 (Customizable
Fields)" / dropdown "Others" + Custom Notes, has been reconciled by Director decision:
merged into Amendment No. 5's own scope above, not registered as a separate
amendment. See Amendment No. 5.)*
